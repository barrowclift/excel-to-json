Workbook to JSON
================

Ever been sitting there thinking to yourself, "Gee, I really wish I could save my Excel workbook sheets to JSON files"? Most likely not honestly. This tool is silly but I needed it for a quick "one-off" project so I threw together this tool for that purpose. Hopefully this will be useful to someone else out there as well.

Please note that this is not as smart as it probably could or should be; it does not format Excel dates into a human-readable format, all number fields are doubles when saved (they always have a trailing ".0" afterwards), and boolean fields are saved with a 0 for False and 1 for True. I'm sure there are other fields that aren't *quite* formatted as expected in the resulting JSON but these are the big ones I know about.

Requires Python 3 and [xlrd](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd) for raw Excel workbook parsing.

Usage
-----

	USAGE: xmlxToJson.py [OPTIONS] ... [FILE.xlsx|FILE.xls] ...
	    -p, --pretty
	        Pretty-print the built JSON files (off by default to help save space,
	        the generated JSON files are big)

	    -s N, --split=N
	        Split up the generated JSON into multiple files. For example, an N of
	        1000 would start a new JSON file when the 1000th root child element was
	        written.

	        The generated files will have the naming convention FILENAME_1.json,
	        FILENAME_2.json, etc.
